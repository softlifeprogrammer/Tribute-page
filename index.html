        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Albert Einstein's life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany</li>
          <li>
            In 1905, Einstein proposed the existence of the photon, an
            elementary particle associated with electromagnetic radiation
            (light), which was the foundation of quantum theory.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1909, Einstein showed that the photon carries momentum as well as
            energy and that electromagnetic radiation must have both
            particle-like and wave-like properties if Planck's law holds; this
            was a forerunner of the principle of wave–particle duality. He would
            go on to receive the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1905, Einstein developed a theory of Brownian motion in terms of
            fluctuations in the number of molecular collisions with an object,
            providing further evidence that matter was composed of atoms. A few
            weeks earlier, he had derived the Einstein relation for diffusion,
            which was the first example of the general fluctuation-dissipation
            theorem and allowed a good estimate of the Avogadro constant.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1905, Einstein developed the theory of special relativity, which
            reconciled the relativity of motion with the observed constancy of
            the speed of light (a paradox of 19th-century physics). Special
            relativity is now a core principle of physics. Its counterintuitive
            predictions that moving clocks run more slowly, that moving objects
            are shortened in their direction of motion, and that the order of
            events is not absolute have been confirmed experimentally.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1905, Einstein developed his concept of Mass–energy equivalence.
            Its relation E=mc2 suggested that matter was a form of energy, which
            was later verified by the mass defect in atomic nuclei. The energy
            released in nuclear reactions—which is essential for nuclear power
            and nuclear weapons—can be estimated from such mass defects.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1907 and again in 1911, Einstein developed the first quantum
            theory of specific heats by generalizing Planck's law. His theory
            resolved a paradox of 19th-century physics that specific heats were
            often smaller than could be explained by any classical theory. His
            work was also the first to show that Planck's quantum mechanical law
            E=hν was a fundamental law of physics, and not merely special to
            blackbody radiation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Between 1907 and 1915, Einstein developed the theory of general
            relativity, a classical field theory of gravitation that provides
            the cornerstone for modern astrophysics and cosmology. General
            relativity is based on the surprising idea that time and space
            dynamically interact with matter and energy, and has been checked
            experimentally in many ways, confirming its predictions of matter
            affecting the flow of time, frame dragging, black holes, and
            gravitational waves.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1917, Einstein published the idea for the
            Einstein–Brillouin–Keller method for finding the quantum mechanical
            version of a classical system. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom
            is a simple example, but the EBK method also gives accurate
            predictions for more complicated systems, such as the dinuclear
            cations H2+ and HeH2+.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1918, Einstein developed a general theory of the process by which
            atoms emit and absorb electromagnetic radiation (his A and B
            coefficients), which is the basis of lasers (stimulated emission)
            and shaped the development of modern quantum electrodynamics, the
            best-validated physical theory at present.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1924, together with Satyendra Nath Bose, Einstein developed the
            theory of Bose–Einstein statistics and Bose–Einstein condensates,
            which form the basis for superfluidity, superconductivity, and other
            phenomena.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1935, together with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, Einstein put
            forward what is now known as the EPR paradox, and argued that the
            quantum-mechanical wave function must be an incomplete description
            of the physical world.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the final thirty years of his life, Einstein explored whether
            various classical unified field theories could account for both
            electromagnetism and gravitation and, possibly, quantum mechanics.
            However, his efforts were unsuccessful, since those theories did not
            match experimental observations.

          <li>Died April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.</li>
